### Part 2 original project definition for CSCI6370 Netflix Study

Cluster the users on the Netfix Prize data.  You may use K-means or any clustering algorithm.

To perform clustering, you need to come up with a "point" to represent each user. This point is a vector of some features. For example, you can define a vector as all the ratings for all the movies. Say we have 17k movies, the length of the vector could be 17k, each component is either 0 or 1.  1 indicates that this user rated this movies,  0 indicates this user never rated this movie. How to define a point is total open and up to you.

Submit:  a report in PDF or Doc format on how you define the "point" to represent a user, what algorithm(s) you use, and the results of clusters.  Screenshots will be helpful.
